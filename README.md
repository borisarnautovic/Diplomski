If you want to run app first you need to type in terminal <npm install>
Then you need to change ip idress in src/const.js and in src/index.hml, line 16 <a class="nav-link text-danger" id="nav-link" href="http://YOUR IP:3000/mobilni"> 
Then type in termianl <npm run watch> to build changes and then <npm start> to start the app.
  
  Then go to your desktop browser and search localhost:3000 
  Scan QR code with your phone (you need to open link with Mozzila firefox browser on your phone, it only works on this browser for now)
  Put your phone on flat surface to stabilize it, play a song on desktop web audio player and rotate your phone to change volume.
  
  I hope you like it :)
